##### Chess Project
This file is in both the original RMD file format and a PDF version for the readers convience.

 Then I conduct EDA on the data to view the distributions of wins, losses, draws, and the ratings of players.
  Finally, I use logistic regression and KNN to predict who will win each chess game.
